    </em>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425°F and position rack in the centre. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Peel and mince the garlic.</li>
        <li>Wash the asparagus and snap (or cut) off the woody ends. Transfer to the baking sheet. 
            Drizzle with olive oil and season with the minced garlic and salt and pepper; toss to coat. 
            Spread out in a single layer, leaving room for the salmon in the middle.</li>
        <li>Place the salmon fillets, skin-side down, in the middle of the baking sheet. 
            Rub with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Place in the oven and bake until the salmon is opaque and the asparagus is tender, 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Let it brown slightly, then remove from heat. 
            Stir in the balsamic vinegar and soy sauce. Cover to keep warm.</li>
        <li>To serve, arrange asparagus on a plate and place the salmon on top. Spoon the balsamic-butter sauce over top. Enjoy!</li>
