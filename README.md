Recipes Project for TOP
https://neevliberman.github.io/odin-recipes/

This website of mine is the first project for The Odin Project. 
It's a kind of Mealime clone, using just HTML basics. The site consists of my three favorite recipes from Mealime. I took the ingredients and steps from Mealime directly but did all the HTML structuring myself. Please take a look and enjoy! Maybe try a recipe (or three) :) .
